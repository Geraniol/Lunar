# Background Story (Tentative)
As Christmas approaches, the character of my story, little P-Chan(tentative), who resides on the Moon, longs to return to its homeland, Earth. However, a ticket from SpaceY costs $1k, and P-Chan only has $200. Determined to reach Earth, P-Chan decides to take a part-time delivery job at WcDonal's. To finish this story, do the best to overcome obstacles, deliver food on time, and keep an eye on the oxygen pressure.
